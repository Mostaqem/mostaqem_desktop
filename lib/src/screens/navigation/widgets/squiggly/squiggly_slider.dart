/// The Squiggly Sliders value is part of the Stateful widget subclass to change the value
/// setState was called.
/// The squiggly sinus curve can be controlled by the [squiggleAmplitude] and [squiggleWavelength] parameters.
/// The [squiggleSpeed] parameter controls the speed of the animation.
///
/// ** See code in examples/lib/main.dart **
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [Slider] for more information about the component parts of a slider.
class SquigglySlider extends Slider {
  /// Creates a squiggly Material Design slider.
  ///
  /// The squiggle itself is a sinus curve with rounded edges, vertically centered
  /// its amplitude and wavelength can be adjusted by [squiggleAmplitude] and [squiggleWavelength] respectively,
  /// the curve itself is animated, and the animation speed can be adjusted with [squiggleSpeed] which controls how many waves pass from left to right in one second.
  ///
  /// The slider itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the state of
  /// the slider changes, the widget calls the [onChanged] callback. Most
  /// widgets that use a slider will listen for the [onChanged] callback and
  /// rebuild the slider with a new [value] to update the visual appearance of
  /// the slider.
  ///
  /// * [value] determines currently selected value for this slider.
  /// * [onChanged] is called while the user is selecting a new value for the
  ///   slider.
  /// * [onChangeStart] is called when the user starts to select a new value for
  ///   the slider.
  /// * [onChangeEnd] is called when the user is done selecting a new value for
  ///   the slider.
  ///
  /// You can override some of the colors with the [activeColor] and
  /// [inactiveColor] properties, although more fine-grained control of the
  /// appearance is achieved using a [SliderThemeData].
  ///
  /// A slider can be used to select from either a continuous or a discrete set of
  /// values. The default is to use a continuous range of values from [min] to
  /// [max]. To use discrete values, use a non-null value for [divisions], which
  /// indicates the number of discrete intervals. For example, if [min] is 0.0 and
  /// [max] is 50.0 and [divisions] is 5, then the slider can take on the
  /// discrete values 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, and 50.0.
  ///
  /// The terms for the parts of a slider are:
  ///
  ///  * The "thumb", which is a shape that slides horizontally when the user
  ///    drags it.
  ///  * The "track", which is the line that the slider thumb slides along.
  ///  * The "value indicator", which is a shape that pops up when the user
  ///    is dragging the thumb to indicate the value being selected.
  ///  * The "active" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
  ///    minimum value.
  ///  * The "inactive" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the
  ///    maximum value.
  ///
  /// The slider will be disabled if [onChanged] is null or if the range given by
  /// [min]..[max] is empty (i.e. if [min] is equal to [max]).
  ///
  /// The slider widget itself does not maintain any state. Instead, when the state
  /// of the slider changes, the widget calls the [onChanged] callback. Most
  /// widgets that use a slider will listen for the [onChanged] callback and
  /// rebuild the slider with a new [value] to update the visual appearance of the
  /// slider. To know when the value starts to change, or when it is done
  /// changing, set the optional callbacks [onChangeStart] and/or [onChangeEnd].
  ///
  /// By default, a slider will be as wide as possible, centered vertically. When
  /// given unbounded constraints, it will attempt to make the track 144 pixels
  /// wide (with margins on each side) and will shrink-wrap vertically.
